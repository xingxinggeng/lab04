    Now write a function to perform encryption using the Caesar cipher. 
    The first few lines of this function need to create your alphabet 
    using the helpher function you created.

    Then you will have to use a for loop to go through the characters 
    of your plaintext and for each character you will have to choose 
    the character from the alphabet that is key positions forward in 
    the alphabet. Be careful for the cases where you will have to 
    cycle around the ends of the alphabet.
